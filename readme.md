# ELAI

ELAI => ELement Added Interface, ELAI is a tool to quickly select and manipulate elements in a web page or create new ones and make changes on the fly.

### [Live version](https://vanillapixel.github.io/ELAI/)

## USE CASE

Basically what you can normally do with the developer tools but **code** and **pain free**.

Don't panic if the page gets totally wrecked. When ELAI is active, the overflow of all the elements in the page is forcely set to visible to move the elements around in a handier way.
Once the script is deactivated, the overflow will return to be as it was before the activation.

Ideal for:

- designers who want to quickly show changes to make to a web page without downloading the page or open Photoshop.
- developers who need to test changes quickly.
- for anybody who would just use it for fun and troll friends manipulating websites with it, I guess?
